# reactStartup
## 4/18/2023
<p>React is acctually a lot easier than I thought ti would be. I followed along with professor Jensen's simon video and things went really well. I got the login stuff all set up although the CSS formating still needs to be changed some. the authentication is all working well though. The menu bar was really straight forward although I still need to fix the fonts so that it looks like my origional website. All the other CSS for the menue bar came together nicely. I didn't get all my functions working, especially on my two main pages (stats and list) however I got it all working on my about page and the login page. overall it was pretty straight forward, I just followed the instructions. The only problem I had was when creating the files at the begining. </p>
<p> for the grading here is what I think I should get points on:<p></p>
<p>React components for About, login and Stats page. they're not all finished (and the list hasn't had much done at all) but I do have multiple components and they are working. </p>
<p>React router. I fullfilled this by doing the header.</p>
<p>React hooks. I'm not sure if I've done enough of these to get full credit. I mostly did them in the login and about page. The stats one are not yet working</p>
<p>Bundled using babel. I think I got this working? I'm not quite sure how to check. </p>
<p>I did lots of Git commits in this repository (I made a new one as opposed to using my origional startup and mixing the code)</p>
<p>Notes: right here = )</p>
